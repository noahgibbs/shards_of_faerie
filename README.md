# Shards of Faerie

Do you ever circle around an idea, prototyping things around it, over and over?

I keep asking myself, "what would a MUD look like in a modern web environment?" What would it be? What would it do? I don't mean a literal telnet-using text-only game. But what's the equivalent?

This is a derelict playground, not a paid-for amusement park. If you find something useful, awesome! Feel free to play with it. If you expect anything to be kept in working order, good luck with that.

## Requirements

In general, I try to keep everything declared in the Gemfile. But, y'know, no guarantees. If me running with Bundler won't catch the problem, I may not know about it.
